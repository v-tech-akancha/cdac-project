-------------------------------------------------------Model_Used-----------------------
1. Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to enhance predictive performance. It is known for its robustness against overfitting and the ability to handle complex relationships in data.
2. Decision Tree: Decision Trees are versatile and interpretable models that partition data based on the values of input features.
3. Linear Regression: Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful model for predicting numerical outcomes like health insurance costs. It establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
4. Gradient Boosting-Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning method that builds a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak learners. Gradient Boosting can capture nonlinear relationships and provide high predictive accuracy.
